## 1. Automatic_Image_Captioning

This project implements a CNN-RNN model for automatic image captioning. The model takes an image as input and generates a sequence of text that describes the image content. 

**Key features:**

* Uses a pre-trained ResNet model as the CNN backbone.
* Employs a LSTM network as the RNN for sequence generation.
* Trained on the COCO dataset.

**Usage:**

1. Install the required dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV).
2. Download the pre-trained weights.
3. Run the `Image_Captioning.ipynb` script to generate captions for images.
